    title: 'Regulatory Constraints on Savings',
    content: 'Government-imposed regulations limit contributions and impose penalties on savings and investment accounts. These constraints channel individuals toward traditional, lower-yield options and stifle innovative investment strategies. Penalties for early withdrawal and strict compliance requirements reinforce adherence to predefined financial paths.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Contribution limits restrict savings',
      'Early withdrawal penalties',
      'Regulations favor traditional options',
      'Stifled innovative strategies'
    ],
    transcript: 'Regulatory constraints significantly limit how individuals can save and invest. Contribution limits on retirement accounts restrict wealth accumulation. Early withdrawal penalties trap funds. These regulations often protect existing government structures rather than benefit the public, as Thomas Sowell observed. The system channels people toward lower-yield traditional options while innovative strategies remain inaccessible.',

    title: 'Social Programs and Dependency',
    content: 'Government social programs, though intended as support systems, frequently foster long-term dependency. Thomas Sowell critiqued the welfare state, arguing that programs like the War on Poverty bred economic stagnation rather than mobility by making people reliant on aid. These programs disincentivize earning more due to benefit reductions with higher income.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Programs create long-term dependency',
      'Disincentivize income growth',
      'Benefit cliffs trap participants',
      'Economic stagnation over mobility'
    ],
    transcript: 'Social programs often create unintended consequences. While designed to help, they frequently trap participants in cycles of dependency. Sowell\'s critique of the War on Poverty revealed how these programs bred stagnation rather than mobility. Benefit cliffs mean earning more results in losing benefits, creating a disincentive to improve one\'s financial situation. This perpetuates reliance on government aid.',
