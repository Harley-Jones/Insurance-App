    title: 'Advertising Restrictions and Financial Literacy',
    content: 'A lesser-discussed form of G.R.I.P. is the limitation on the promotion of alternative financial products like cash value life insurance. Regulations restrict the advertisement and public discussion of such products, reducing financial literacy and understanding of diverse wealth-building methods. This underexposure leads individuals to follow conventional, often less effective, paths.',
